hey this is an exercise from scrimba to understand a little better how useEffect works in React!
in the following files you'll find a simple page that tracks and display its own width by setting up 
react states, interacting with an outside system or effect and keeping track of it on its state.

quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
